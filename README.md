# Amit-Ilay_Unsupervised

To run the code, please download the data and change the directory to the correct one.
Install the following packages:
  !pip install pandas
  !pip install numpy
  !pip install seaborn
  !pip install -U scikit-learn
  !pip install tabulate
  !pip install umap-learn
  !pip install ruptures
  !pip install statsmodels

The code is a bit messy, so we uploaded the notebook we used for this project, too.
All figures seen in the paper are present here.
